Each folder contains a different inference tool, with a main, supporting code, and a sandbox (instead of testing... will consider adding tests as this gets bigger)

Each tool will require some customization before running. For example, necessaryCookies relies on the fetchInfo, paste your fetch from Chrome Dev Tools here (separated into url and options) 

Then run: node /path/ main.mjs
